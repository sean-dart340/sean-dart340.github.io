        <h3 id="subhead"><em>Sean Cornely, Digital Art and Design Major.</em></h3>
        <div id="about">
        <p>I began my graphic design career in Fall of 2014, aged 13. I am now 21 years old and a Senior at La Salle University where I am pursuing a degree in Digital Art and Multimedia Design. Throughout my career I have made many strides including a conference call with the Marketing Manager of the Philadelphia Flyers in regards to a jersey design that I had made, as well as a response from the Arctic Monkeys booking agents about a tee shirt design that I had also constructed. Some of my sports photography also lives on my "Gallery" page. I am also currently apart of the Philadelphia Union's "Creators Collective"<br><br>

I started doing sports photography in my sophomore year of college. I reached out to the athletic department to do design work, but their only openings were in photography and videography, so I began that way. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity given to me as I have progressed greatly in the last few years.<br><br>

In high school, I designed nearly everything that my student body needed. I made our prom tickets, all four of our class shirts, the programs for our Homecoming Football games, and many other graphics. <br><br>

I would love to continue growing my career, so if you are interested in my talents, please feel free to contact me and review my resume.

Thank you.</p>
